SPECIES INVADERS
================

An "invasive species" RESTful API for [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/problems/invasive-species-identification).

OVERVIEW
--------

Proposed use-cases for apps/sites/widgets which would use this API:

- Browse by "activity" (e.g. "camping", "hiking", "canoeing", "fishing", etc.)
- "I'm going from/to here, what should I watch out for?"
- "I'm here, what should I watch out for?"
- "I see something, what is it? Is it invasive?"
- "This place has something invasive, others should be aware!"
- The ability to administer the data sets

We'll be developing a RESTful API in PHP, initially responding w/JSON data, and hopefully a proof-of-concept JavaScript widget.
